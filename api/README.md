Civic Complaints API ‚Äî FastAPI MVP (Clean Karachi)

A lightweight API to route citizen complaints to the right elected representatives (MNA/MPA) and crowd-prioritize them with local voting.

Framework: FastAPI

Database: SQLite (data/civic.db)

Auth: Omitted in MVP (JWT planned)

Run: uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000

Docs: Swagger UI /docs, ReDoc /redoc

üöÄ Problem  Pitch 

Citizens submit issues (trash, water, roads) with GPS. The API maps the location to a constituency (demo boxes), auto-assigns the complaint to the relevant MNA/MPA, and lets the community vote (+1/‚àí1). Reps get a prioritized queue by public support.

üéØ Why It Matters (Impact)

Transparency: Publicly visible assignment to elected reps.

Prioritization: Voting surfaces hotspots quickly.

Low friction: Works with phone GPS; minimal input required.

Local relevance: Designed around Karachi‚Äôs NA/PS structure, but portable.

Future impact (ready hooks): severity scoring, automated summaries for reps, hotspot clustering.

‚úÖ What‚Äôs Built (Completeness)

Complaint lifecycle: create ‚Üí (auto) assign ‚Üí vote ‚Üí status updates ‚Üí summary

Assignment logic: bounding-box resolver (demo) to NA/PS codes; override supported

Voting model: one vote per voter_id per complaint (upsert on re-vote)

Seed data: sample MNA/MPA reps for Karachi South/East

API docs: Swagger + Redoc auto-generated

Tests: minimal flow test under tests/

ü§ñ AI Leverage (now & near-term)

Now (architecture-ready):

Endpoints & schemas designed to plug in:

LLM summaries of clustered complaints for reps

Auto-classification (sanitation/water/roads), severity scoring

Deduplication via text/geo similarity

Near-term add-ons (post-MVP):

LLM assistant to generate status updates for reps

Geo-clustering (DBSCAN/HDBSCAN) to detect hot zones

Photo OCR & extraction for richer reports

üß≠ UX Overview (API consumer & end user)

API consumer (frontends/bots): simple JSON contracts; instant Swagger docs

End user: minimal form ‚Üí title, optional description, GPS ‚Üí submit ‚Üí vote/track

Reps: list of complaints filtered by constituency with vote totals

A tiny web/mobile UI can be layered on this API in hours.

  "area_code_na": null,
  "area_code_ps": null
}


Returns (excerpt):

{
  "id": 1,
  "area_code_na": "NA-247",
  "area_code_ps": "PS-110",
  "status": "new",
  "mna": {"code":"NA-247","name":"Example MNA South"},
  "mpa": {"code":"PS-110","name":"Example MPA South"},
  "votes_total": 0
}

Vote

POST /complaints/{id}/vote

{ "voter_id": "user-92300", "value": 1 }


Returns: complaint summary with updated votes_total.

Update status

PATCH /complaints/{id}/status

{ "status": "in_progress" }

Seed demo reps

POST /seed/example ‚Üí installs NA-247 / PS-110 / NA-242 / PS-102 examples.

Full schema & try-it-now in Swagger.

üß™ Quick Demo Script (10 minutes)

Seed reps ‚Üí POST /seed/example

Create complaint (DHA coords) ‚Üí auto NA-247 / PS-110, summary shows MNA/MPA

Vote (+1, then ‚àí1) ‚Üí show upsert & totals

Update status ‚Üí in_progress

List & summary views ‚Üí show prioritization by votes

Explain AI hooks (classification, severity, clustering, summaries)

Tip: keep the terminal + Swagger side-by-side while presenting.

üó∫Ô∏è Constituency Logic (MVP)

Bounding boxes for Karachi South (NA-247, PS-110) and Karachi East (NA-242, PS-102)

Outside boxes ‚Üí NA-000 / PS-000

Override supported via area_code_na / area_code_ps

Upgrade path: replace with official polygons (PostGIS), or a hosted geocoder.
